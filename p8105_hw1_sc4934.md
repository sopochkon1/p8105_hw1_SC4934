# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The penguins data set contains 8 variables. The variables contain
information on individual penguins, including the species, island where
they are located, bill length in mm, bill depth in mm, etc.

include more detail above:

There are 344 rows `nrow` and 8 columns `ncol` in the data set.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152 mm.

``` r
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 200.9152

Scatter plot:

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```
