# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## description:

The penguins data set contains 8 variables. The variables contain
information on individual penguins, including the species, island where
they are located, bill length in mm, bill depth in mm, etc.

There are 344 rows `nrow` and 8 columns `ncol` in the data set.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152 mm.

``` r
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 200.9152

## Scatter Plot:

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

# Problem 2

## dataframe:

``` r
df <- tibble(
  var_norm = rnorm(n=10),
  var_logic = var_norm > 0,
  var_char = c("one", "two","three","four","five","six","seven","eight","nine","ten"),
  var_fac = factor(c("low","medium","high","low","medium","high","low","medium","high", "low" ))
  )
```

## means

``` r
mean(pull(df, var_norm))
```

    ## [1] 0.47576

``` r
mean(pull(df, var_logic))
```

    ## [1] 0.8

``` r
mean(pull(df, var_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, var_char)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df, var_fac))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, var_fac)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

taking the mean of `var_norm`, a variable with a random sample from a
standard normal distribution worked.

taking the mean of `var_logic`, a logical variable also worked.

R is not able to take the mean of `var_char` and `var_fac`, as they are
character and factor variables.

## convert variables

``` r
as.numeric(df$var_logic)
as.numeric(df$var_char)
as.numeric(df$var_fac)
```

I am convert the logical and factor variables, but not the character
variable.

Does this help explain what happens when you try to take the mean?
