# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## description:

The penguins data set contains 8 variables. The variables contain
information on individual penguins, including the species, island where
they are located, bill length in mm, bill depth in mm, body mass in g,
etc.

There are 344 rows `nrow` and 8 columns `ncol` in the data set.

``` r
skimr::skim(penguins)
```

we can use the `skim` command to look closer at the variables. For
example, we can see that there are 3 factor and 5 numeric column types
in the dataset. It seems like the most missing values are in the `sex`
variable.

## mean:

The mean flipper length is 200.9152 mm.

``` r
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 200.9152

## Scatter Plot:

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

# Problem 2

## dataframe:

``` r
df <- tibble(
  var_norm = rnorm(n = 10),
  var_logic = var_norm > 0,
  var_char = c("one", "two","three","four","five","six","seven","eight","nine","ten"),
  var_fac = factor(c("low","medium","high","low","medium","high","low","medium","high", "low" ))
  )
```

## means

``` r
mean(pull(df, var_norm))
```

    ## [1] -0.06684895

``` r
mean(pull(df, var_logic))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(df, var_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, var_char)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df, var_fac))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, var_fac)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

taking the mean of `var_norm`, a variable with a random sample from a
standard normal distribution worked.

taking the mean of `var_logic`, a logical variable also worked.

R is not able to take the mean of `var_char` and `var_fac`, as they are
character and factor variables.

## convert variables

``` r
as.numeric(df$var_logic)
as.numeric(df$var_char)
as.numeric(df$var_fac)
```

I am able to convert the logical and factor variables, but not the
character variable.

I was able to convert the factor variable because each numeric value
(1,2, and 3) is attached to the levels I defined (low,medium,high).
therefore, after converting it to the numeric format, I can take the
mean.

I was able to convert the logical variable as it can be converted to a 1
or 0 depending of if it is true or false. I was able to to take the mean
before converting it to numeric, as R assigned boolean values depending
on if it is True or False.

It explains why I was not able to take the mean of the character
variable, as there is no numeric value attached to it, and I can not
convert it to a numeric variable.
