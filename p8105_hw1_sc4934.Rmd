# Problem 1

```{r cars}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The penguins data set contains 8 variables. The variables contain information on individual penguins, including the species, island where they are located, bill length in mm, bill depth in mm, etc. 

include more detail above:

There are 344 rows `nrow` and 8 columns `ncol` in the data set.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152 mm. 

```{r}
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```


Scatter plot: 

```{r chunk_scatterplot, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
ggsave ("scatter_plot.pdf")

```
